# Building an app using CycleJS with JWT Authentication

Learn how to implement an application with CycleJS that Authenticates using JWT

## Introduction

Reactive programming is one of the developments concepts that started in the graphics and video processing and now is coming to the Web UI, and it is doing so mainly by the ReactiveX which is a compendium of libraries that help with the usage of Observable collections,  and with them is possible to execute operations over the objects. But develop an application with it can be an intimidating task, particularly with such abstract concepts.

But Andre Saltz, one of the core contributor of the RxJS project, bring us the CycleJS, a framework to build Reactive applications that simplifies the process with a clever cyclic architecture composed on input and output of streams, the great thing about it is that you can plug the RxJS library or use a suited implementation for it called "xstream" that simplify the learning curve call "xstream" wich is a much simpler version of the RxJS library with exclusive support for hot streams.

All this new words and terms can be quite intimidating at first, but with some practice and patience, you will be able to understand them and applying in a way that suits your needs.
