# Creation of the pre-example app

First I created an application with the basic elements of CycleJS, after watching the tutorial
I look for the repositories of the author and found this repo where to get some examples to 
start.

https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/tree/master/examples

I used the counter example to get around the idea of the basic dependencies and project structure.
then I start updating the initialization scripts so it will start a basic http-browser to run the project.

I started with the creation of a simple project that load the random using a simple http request.

With this I was able to create a very basic package.json with the minimal dependencies to work with cyclejs.

- look at the pre-example folder to check the basic project.

# Working on the final project

- For the initial configuration is necesary to have the .babelrc file with the es2005 property.
- Is also important to make sure the prebrowserify is executed when the watchify is running.

- The first part is to add some easy design elements, I will use foundation as starting point.
