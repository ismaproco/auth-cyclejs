# Creation of the pre-example app

First I created an application with the basic elements of CycleJS, after watching the tutorial
I look for the repositories of the author and found this repo where to get some examples to 
start.

https://github.com/cyclejs/cyclejs/tree/master/examples

I used the counter example to get around the idea of the basic dependencies and project structure.
then I start updating the initialization scripts so it will start a basic http-browser to run the project.
